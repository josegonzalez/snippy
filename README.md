# snippy
An IRC Bot for screeps

# Installation
Snippy is not meant to be replicated en masse as of yet.  It can be run using `npm start`, though you must supply environment variables for it to function properly

Take a copy of the settings-default.js and name it to settings.js then fill in the needed variables. If a setting is left disabled then the settings under it don't need to be filled in.

# Roadmap

I might want to make this act as more of a barebones bot with optional plugins, but that's farther down the road.  If anyone wants to work on something like that, feel free to.

# Contributing
